					<h2>Guggenheim Museum</h2>
					<p>From 1943 to early 1944, Wright produced four different sketches for the initial design. 
						While one of the plans had a hexagonal shape and level floors for the galleries, all
						the others had circular schemes and used a ramp continuing around the building. 
						Wright's original concept was called an inverted "ziggurat", because it resembled the
						steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. His design dispensed with 	
						the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series
						of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting.For more information check: <a

					<h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
					<p>When it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of 
						trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering.
						However, Eiffel and his team of experienced bridge builders understood the importance
						of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the
						world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. He used graphical methods to
						determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects 
						of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. <a
